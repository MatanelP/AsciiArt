I chose to use collections in 3 different parts of the exercise:

1)  In BrightnessImgCharMatcher, by holding a hash map and saving the average brightness of images.
    I was able to calculate and render an image in much more efficient way thanks to the hash map constant
    time for getting a stored value (average) given a key (image).
2)
3) In uniqueMorseRepresentations, taking advantage of a hash map look up time as explained below.
